					<div class="ser_subheader">Locating embedded objects</div>
					<div class="ser_description">Many On Target Construction clients need to drill or cut through
						concrete. Before drilling, cutting, or coring through any concrete structure concrete scanning
						is necessary. On Target Construction can identify the location and depth of the embedded objects
						in the structure using high resolution Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR). On Target Construction
						can help you accurately, reliably, and economically locate:

						<ul>
							<li>Non-metallic and metallic utilities</li>
							<li>Conduits</li>
							<li> Mesh conduits</li>
							<li>Post-tension cables</li>
							<li>Pre-tension cables</li>
							<li>Pipes</li>
							<li>Rebar</li>
							<li> Slab thickness and voids</li>
						</ul>
						We are a local company serving all of Lower Mainland, including Vancouver, Burnaby, Coquitlam.

					<div class='ser_subheader'>Pressure injection concrete waterproofing</div>

					<div class="ser_description">Cracks in the building substance are common in aging buildings as well
						as some newer buildings and foundations due to ground movement and other reasons. They often
						allow water penetrate which causes damage to the interior finish and may reduce the usage and
						lifetime of the entire building. To eliminate the problem an elastic sealing and
						structural-bonding of the crack is required. Our method is the least expensive known permanent
						solution and it works by filling the crack or voids in the concrete with polyurethane resin via
						pressure injection. High pressure generated by expanding capabilities of the polyurethane mix
						ensures even the tiniest hairline crack is filled with waterproofing material. You do not need
						to dig as long as there is access to the affected area.</div>
